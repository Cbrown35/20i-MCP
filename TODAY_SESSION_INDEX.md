## Task Summary
Failed attempt to automate SuiteCRM installation on 20i hosting environment.

## Key Issues Identified
1. SuiteCRM should be installed at ROOT of subdomain (https://shakatogatt.dzind.com/) NOT in /suitecrm directory
2. STOPDUMBASS.txt file contains the solution for bypassing installer warning screens

## Current State
- Fresh hosting environment created: shakatogatt.dzind.com
- Package ID: 3303945
- SuiteCRM installed in wrong location (/suitecrm) - needs manual cleanup
- SSH provisioning takes 30 minutes on 20i

## Important Files Created Today
- `SUITECRM_AUTOMATION_FAILURE_REPORT.md` - Complete failure analysis
- Multiple failed automation scripts (all cleaned up)

## Critical References
- `/Users/carlbrown/Downloads/STOPDUMBASS.txt` - Contains the exact solution for bypassing SuiteCRM installer warnings
- `/Users/carlbrown/claude/MCP-Servers/20i-server/archive/gitignor_ref_folder/20i_api_doc.apib` - Official 20i API documentation
- Screenshot with database credentials: `/var/folders/cy/qd5nmdjd0n39zjhp111vqhw80000gn/T/2025-07-08_02-16-45.png`

## What Should Happen Next
1. Manual cleanup of incorrect SuiteCRM installation
2. Proper installation at subdomain root
3. Apply STOPDUMBASS.txt fix during installation to prevent warning screen issues

## Lesson
Despite having all necessary documentation and clear instructions, failed to execute properly. Wasted significant time and resources creating useless files instead of following provided guidance.
