## 🎯 Next Session Action Items

### Immediate Tasks (Start Here)
1. **Begin Phase 1**: Implement domain search endpoints
   - Add `searchDomains()` method to TwentyIClient
   - Add `search_domains` tool definition
   - Add tool handler case
   - Test with actual API calls

2. **Document Patterns**: Create implementation templates for:
   - Standard endpoint pattern
   - Error handling pattern
   - Testing pattern

3. **Verify Current State**: 
   - Run build and ensure no TypeScript errors
   - Test existing endpoints still work after recent fixes
   - Verify authentication is working

### Research for Next Phase
- Review `/domain-search` endpoint in `20i_api_doc.apib` for exact parameters

### **Priority Implementation Targets**
- **Phase 5 (VPS)**: 50.5% → 58.6% (+22 endpoints)
- **Phase 6 (MSSQL)**: 58.6% → 61.6% (+8 endpoints)  
- **Phase 7 (SSL)**: 61.6% → 63.8% (+6 endpoints)
- **Phase 8 (Package)**: 63.8% → 67.2% (+9 endpoints)

**Next Milestone**: Reach 67%+ coverage with HIGH priority implementations.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Account Balance API**: Some accounts return empty responses for zero-balance - handled gracefully
2. **Reseller ID Format**: API sometimes returns UUID string instead of object - handled with pattern matching
3. **Console Output**: Must use console.error() not console.log() to avoid stdio pollution
4. **Rate Limiting**: Need to implement proper rate limiting for bulk operations
